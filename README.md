Hi, I'm Aaron Ciminelli. I am a highly experienced US Military Veteran who thrives in fast-paced and demanding environments. Throughout my career, I have honed my problem-solving skills and developed the ability to invent successful solutions, which have proven invaluable in my past experiences. I am proud of my history of effectively managing and evaluating staff performance to identify areas for improvement, leading to improved team performance.

My greatest strengths are developing and implementing improved training procedures, organizational policies, and streamlined processes. I take pride in my verbal and written communication skills. I have a proven track record of cultivating positive relationships, enabling me to consistently exceed goals.

In addition to my experience as a highly experienced US Military Veteran, I am a current student set to graduate in September with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My studies have given me a deep understanding of programming languages, software development methodologies, and computer systems. I have gained experience developing software applications, solving complex problems, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

I have developed strong analytical skills and a keen eye for detail, which has helped me identify and resolve errors in my work. I have also become adept at working under pressure and meeting tight deadlines, which are essential skills in the tech industry.
